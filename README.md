# SIMON-Game
The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game that was first released in the late 1970s. It is designed to test and enhance your memory and pattern recognition skills. 
The game consists of a small electronic device with four colored buttons (usually red, green, blue, and yellow) and a built-in speaker.
I have developed using HTML , CSS and javascript .

Here's how the Simon game typically works:

   1. The game starts with a single color button lighting up and emitting a sound.
    
   2. The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the button that lit up. If the game begins with the red button lighting up, the player presses the red button in response.
    
   3. The game continues by adding one more color to the sequence in each round, increasing the complexity and challenge.
    
   4. The player must remember and repeat the entire sequence correctly, including the new color that was just added.
    
   5. If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing a button out of order, the game signals the error, often with a buzzing sound, and the game ends.
